Routing Table

* routes stored in radix tree
* rt_tables_all: array of route tables (per AF)
* configuring 6.6.6.6/24 creates 4 prefixes into routing table
   * 6.6.6.0/32, 6.6.6.255/32 => broadcast routes
* pfx_bit => if pfx_data is NULL, marks the bit at which "left" and "right"
differ
* static and bgp routes only routes with "nhe"
   * all have an adjacency
* rt_head: rth_rib_active => is route active in RIB
* rt_entry: rt_n_bitsset => how many tasks are interested in this rt_entry
* rt attributes are dedup'd in a standard way
* nhe(rts_nh_entry):
   * we receive route with nh 4.4.4.4
   * DUT2 tries to resolve over OPSF prefix 4.4.4.0/24
